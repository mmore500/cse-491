### OUTLINE

- what are modules?
	* new compilation model for c++
	* new way to organize c++ projects

- list of aspects of c++ that modules will affect (maybe with brief example/explanation for each)
	* how code is written
  * how code is parsed
  * how projects are compiled
  * how projects are organized
  * how projects are consumed

- compare old c++ organization/compilation model with module organization/compilation model (this'll be the focus of the blog post)
	* compilation
		* old = preprocess (textual inclusion), compile, and link
	 	* new = precompile, preprocess, compile, link
	* organization
		* old = .hpp, .cpp, main.cpp
		* new = .ixx, .mxx, main.cpp

- brief discussion as to what these changes seek to accomplish (benefits of modules)
	* better build times
	* better encapsulation
	* package management
	* declaration consistancy
	* include order

- brief discussion of module drawbacks
	* compilation order / not parallelizable
	* transition period / legacy code

- conclusion: modules are going to be one of the biggest changes to c++ since standardization
